# Approach/Steps
1. Get an idea of what the project would do. => Frontendmentor.io
2. Wireframe of project => Frontendmentor.io
3. Planned routes based on all features and including all 7 RESTful routes with full CRUD functional
4. Implemented code based on wireframe and planned routes.

# Unresolved 
1. Due to creating multiple collections based on movie genres, when referencing a movie, if movie is in a different genre when added the resulting id generated by mongodb will be different. Leading to the get route to mismatch the genre with the id.
⋅⋅⋅Possible solutions: 
  ⋅⋅⋅A. limit each movie in favorites array using title⋅⋅
  ⋅⋅⋅B. When movie is added into favorites array possibly include the genre it was found in⋅⋅
 
2. Weird bug where the edit or delete icons will not disappear when mouseleaves the element.
